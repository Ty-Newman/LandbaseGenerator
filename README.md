# LandbaseGenerator
A web app that will generate an optimal land base for an MTG deck. This project will build a landbase for an mtg deck including multicolor lands across several MTG formats.
it will also allow a user to store decks and their associated landbases as well as generateing a TCGplayer.com shopping cart with all required lands. This will be done with the TCGplayer api
The user will be required to provide some input, inluding but not limited to:
  - The color(s) of their deck
  - The individual devotion to each color in their deck
  - The total number of lands desired (unless I implment a feature to do this automatically)
  - If the above feature is implemented I will need the mana curve of the deck as well
